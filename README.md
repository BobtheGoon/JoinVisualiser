<h1>Joint drawer</h1>
<p>This is my submition for The Odin Projects restraunt page.</p>
<p>Instead of creating a restraunt page, i decided to make a simple page that would take in some distance and joint design parameters and draw the connection on screen.</p>
<p>The point of this excersise was to get familiar with using webpack to package modules and learn to utilise ES6 modules to package your code</p>
<p>To run the site, git clone the repo, npm install and run "npm run build"</p>
